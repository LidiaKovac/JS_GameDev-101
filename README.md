JavaScript Game Development 101 🧑‍🔬
Hi! My name is Lidia 👋

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! 
This repo is part of a "series" of 101s. 

I am a MERN Stack developer, recently graduated from Strive School. This means I have knowledge of MongoDB (+ Postgres), Express.js, React.js and Node.js.

As part of my autonomous exploration, I am trying out different things. You can find a list of what I have explored so far and what I plan to try next on my GitHub page. 

This is the repository for the very basics of game development in vanilla js. I followed a tutorial from freeCodingCamp on youtube and (likely) I have put my own spin on it.

Do you have feedback? Do not hesitate! Coding is all about always learning something new!
