JavaScript Game Development 101 🧑‍🔬
Hi! My name is Lidia 👋

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! 
This repo is part of a "series" of 101s. 

I am a MERN Stack developer, recently graduated from Strive School. This means I have knowledge of MongoDB (+ Postgres), Express.js, React.js and Node.js.

As part of my autonomous exploration, I am trying out different things. You can find a list of what I have explored so far and what I plan to try next on my GitHub page. 

This is the repository for the very basics of game development in vanilla js. I followed a tutorial from freeCodingCamp on youtube. 

### Update

The more I work on completing this tutorial the more I see many many applications for the things I am learning, even outside of creating games. I am understanding classes better and I think I am going to implement them waaaaay more into my every-day coding. 

### Final Update!

I completed the basic game. It still has a weird bug where sometimes the bricks will not bounce away the ball or the ball clips with the top of the brick.

Do you have feedback? Do not hesitate! Coding is all about always learning something new!
